# First Semester Programming Fundamentals (PF) Lab – Final Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains the **First Semester Programming Fundamentals (PF) Lab Final Project**, developed as part of the undergraduate Computer Science curriculum. The project is implemented in **C++** and is designed as a **console-based application** that demonstrates the practical application of core programming concepts learned during the first semester.

The main objective of this project is to strengthen problem-solving skills, logical thinking, and code organization by building a complete and functional program using foundational programming techniques.
